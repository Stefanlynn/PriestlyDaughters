# Welcome to the Priestly Daughters Community

Dear sister,

If you're reading this, perhaps you've felt it too—that gentle but persistent tug on your heart. A sense that you're meant for more, called to something deeper. A holy discontent with going through the motions of faith without experiencing its transformative power.

## When You Feel Called But Unqualified

You feel it in your spirit—this pull toward more. Maybe it's ministry leadership, creative expression, or bold evangelism. But then comes the doubt: "Who am I to do this? I don't have the right background, education, or platform."

Here's the truth: God's calling on your life has never been contingent on your qualifications. Throughout Scripture, God chose the unlikely, the overlooked, and the underqualified to accomplish His purposes. Moses stuttered. David was the youngest and smallest. The disciples were ordinary fishermen. What qualified them was their willingness to say "yes" to God's invitation.

## The Pressure to Be Everything All at Once

There's this unspoken pressure many women carry to be everything to everyone: the perfect mother, the supportive wife, the successful professional, the dedicated ministry leader, the hospitable neighbor, and the faithful friend—all while maintaining a Pinterest-worthy home and an Instagram-worthy spiritual life.

Let me give you permission to breathe. You weren't created to do it all, and certainly not all at once. Your worth isn't measured by your productivity or how many roles you excel in. Christ's yoke is easy, and His burden is light—if you're feeling crushed under the weight of expectations, that's not from Him.

## Finding Your Place in His Story

The beautiful thing about being a daughter of the King is that you have a unique role in His Kingdom that only you can fill. You don't need to compete with other women or compare your journey to theirs. Your calling might look different, your season might require different things of you, and your gifts will manifest in ways unique to you.

What matters isn't having the biggest platform or the most visible ministry. What matters is faithfulness in the place God has planted you, stewarding well the gifts He's given you, and keeping your eyes fixed on Jesus rather than on others' highlight reels.

## The Invitation

This is your invitation to join us on this journey of discovering what it means to live as a Priestly Daughter—a woman who ministers God's grace in its various forms, who offers her life as a living sacrifice, and who carries the presence of God into every room she enters.

Whether you're just starting your faith journey or you've been walking with Jesus for decades, there's a place for you here. A place to belong, to grow, to serve, and to be transformed by the renewing of your mind.

Welcome home, Priestly Daughter. We've been waiting for you.

With love and expectation,

Elizabeth Powell  
Founder, Priestly Daughters
