## Our Journey

Priestly Daughters began as a small Bible study group in Elizabeth's living room. What started as a gathering of women seeking deeper understanding of Scripture and community has grown into a ministry reaching women across the nation.

The name "Priestly Daughters" comes from our belief that all believers, including women, are called to a royal priesthood (1 Peter 2:9). We believe that women have a unique and vital role in God's kingdom as ministers of His grace and truth.

## Our Vision

We envision a community of women who are:

- Deeply rooted in the Word of God
- Confident in their identity as daughters of the King
- Walking boldly in their calling and purpose
- Supporting one another in love and grace
- Making a significant impact in their homes, churches, and communities

## Our Values

- **Biblical Truth**: We are committed to the authority and sufficiency of Scripture in all areas of life.
- **Authentic Community**: We create spaces for real connection, vulnerability, and growth.
- **Purposeful Living**: We help women discover and walk in their God-given purpose.
- **Generous Grace**: We extend the same grace to others that we have received from Christ.
- **Kingdom Impact**: We equip women to make a lasting difference in their spheres of influence.
