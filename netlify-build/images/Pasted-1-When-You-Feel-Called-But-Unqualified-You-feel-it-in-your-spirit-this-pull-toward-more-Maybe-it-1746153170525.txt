1. When You Feel Called, But Unqualified

You feel it in your spirit—this pull toward more.
Maybe it’s starting that thing God’s been whispering to you about.
Maybe it’s stepping into a new level of leadership, purpose, or influence.

You know you’re called. And yet…
There’s a voice inside that says:
“You’re not ready.”
“You’re not good enough.”
“You’re not spiritual enough.”

I’ve heard those voices too.

The truth is, feeling unqualified doesn’t mean you’re not called—it usually means you’re human.
God never asked for perfection. He asked for obedience. And more often than not, confidence comes after the first step—not before it.

When I transitioned out of my banking career and into full-time motherhood, ministry, and now this new season with Priestly Daughters, I didn’t feel “ready.”
I didn’t have every answer. I didn’t feel polished.
But I had a yes.
And God has honored it every step of the way.

If you’re battling that internal resistance—the fear of not being enough—I want you to know this:

You don’t have to be perfect to be purposeful.
You don’t have to know it all to begin.
And the feeling of being unqualified might just be the greatest sign that you’re in the right place—because it means you’ll have to rely fully on Him.

God has a way of using our weakness as a canvas for His glory.

So go ahead. Take the step.
You’re called—and that’s enough.

2. The Sacred Work of Slowing Down

Let’s be honest: as women, we carry a lot.
We manage homes, raise children, lead teams, care for communities, support our spouses, show up for our churches—and still try to carve out time for ourselves.

In a world that praises hustle, stillness feels like rebellion.
But here’s the truth I’ve come to learn: rest is not weakness. It’s wisdom.

When I left the structured schedule of my career in banking and stepped into a new season of transition, I expected to feel relief.
But instead, I felt lost.
My value had been wrapped in how much I produced. How efficient I was.
How many things I could check off before noon.

God had to reintroduce me to a slower rhythm. One where I didn’t have to earn my worth.
One where quiet wasn’t empty—but sacred.

Slowing down taught me to listen again—not just to the Lord, but to my own soul.
To pay attention to what I needed, to what was off, and to what He was healing beneath the surface.

It’s in the pause that God often speaks the clearest.
It’s in the rest that your roots grow deep.
And it’s in the quiet that you remember you are not what you produce—you are who He created.

So if you’re feeling worn, weary, or stuck in a cycle of overdoing—this is your invitation.
Take a breath. Create margin. Say no.
And know that slowing down doesn’t stop your progress—it strengthens it.

3. Becoming Her: The Journey Between Who You Were and Who You’re Becoming

There’s a version of you that God is shaping—strong, steady, full of wisdom, confident in your identity, and clear about your calling.

But between who you’ve been and who you’re becoming… there’s a gap.
A stretch. A tension. A season that doesn’t always make sense.

I’ve lived in that in-between space.
The space where you know you can’t go back—but you’re not sure what moving forward even looks like.
Where God calls you out of one place but doesn’t give you the full map for the next.

It’s a holy tension. And it’s not something we talk about enough.

Becoming her isn’t always glamorous.
It’s often quiet. Unseen. Internal.
It’s in the mundane rhythms of motherhood. The conversations that stretch you.
The private tears that nobody sees.
The moments you choose obedience over clarity.

But let me tell you this:
Transformation is still happening, even when you can’t see it.

God is doing a work in the wilderness.
He’s refining you in the waiting.
And what feels like delay is often divine development.

You’re not behind—you’re becoming.
You’re not forgotten—you’re being formed.

So give yourself grace.
And keep going.
Because who you’re becoming… she’s worth the stretch.
